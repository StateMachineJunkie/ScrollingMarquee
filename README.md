Updated version of an Objective-C control I wrote years ago.

The original Swift version was written using Swift 2.2, was designed to be added to the view heirarchy and initialized by hand, and requires UIKit. I recently migrated the source from Swift 2 to Swift 5 and changed the integration method to include support for Iterface Builder. Just screwing around to understand better what has changed Xcode 15 beta.
